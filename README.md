## Description

An application to help the user better plan their finances. Each transaction can be added or subtracted depending on if the transaction is a debit or credit. Once the transaction is submitted it will be added to a graph where the user can have a visual of their activity over the past 7 transactions. 

This is a progressive web application. Instead of accessing the application through the browser, the user can download the app from the web browser to their desktop or phone.
